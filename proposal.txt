Encrypy/Decrypt with key

Description:
This program will read in from a file a string and encrypt/decrypt depending on what the user wants. The user will be prompted to choose encrypt or decrypt and then enter a key. The program will use a xor cipher with the user given key to encrypt/decrypt the data. The program will then display the encrypted or decrypted string.

Functions:

encrypt/decrypt
This function will encrypt a string using a xor cipher. One function is used for encryption/decryption since we are doing the same formula.
Input
R0 = string
R1 = key
Output
R0 = encrypted/decrypted string

to_binary
This function will convert ascii to binary.
Input
R0 = ascii number
Output
R0 = binary number

C library calls:

printf - Display the output
fopen - open file
fgets - read line from file
fclose - close file

Error conditions:

1. The input/output file doesn't open properly

2. The input/output file doesn't close properly

3. The key wasn't a number

4. The choice to encrypt/decrypt wasn't 1 or 2.
