main.s
Open and close files and dispaly encrypted/decrypted string

@ Ask user to encrypt or decrypt file with 1 or 2
@ If not 1 or 2 entered display error
@ Ask user for a key
@ If key is not a number display error
@ Open the input.txt and output.txt file
@ If file doesn't open display error
@ Read from the input file one line at a time
@ For each line in input.txt
@	For each char in line
@ 		encrypt_decrypt(char);
@ Copy the char to line
@		copy{char};
@ Display the line of encryted/decypted characters
@	printf(line);
@ Copy the line to output.txt

@ 	Shift decimal sum over 1 digit
@ 	Add binary to decimal sum
@ 	Go to next character in string
